          No one should be on the phone haggling for construction materials. Technology should already be powering an innovative
          bidding solution for developers, builders, and contractors to share their material needs, timelines, and specifications.
          </p>
          <p>But as of yesterday, no one was buying <br>
              materials the right way
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Today, there's BuildGrid. Sorry for the wait.</strong>

                <p>
                At BuildGrid, we’ve examined the problems in procuring materials from both the developer and
                contractor points-of-view. Seeing both sides helped us recognize the only solution that can truly
                bring us into the future. <strong>We need a transparent marketplace</strong>—one that invites relevant vendors to
                participate in an open and fair bidding process. <strong>And that’s what we’ve built.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                Our leadership team has long been pushing the industry into the future. From building ReGreen, a
                diversified construction and engineering firm in the energy efficiency and renewable energy space,
                to co-founding UrbanBlox, a real estate development firm with over 100M in project pipeline.
                </p>

                <p>
                Now we are determined to forever change the broken process of purchasing materials in construction.
                <strong>And BuildGrid is a simple, yet powerful solution</strong>, to fix the problem from both sides of the process.

                <p><strong>BuildGrid is a nationwide purchasing materials marketplace.</strong></p>

                <p>
                    It's instant, accessible, and most important, transparent. <strong>It's the future of project bids and construction purchasing,</strong>
                    <br>
                    but it's here right now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We've removed all of the pain points for sellers to compete, and made it easy for purchasers to make their choice. <strong> We've also
                    made it fast and cost efficient for everyone. We can eve help you free up valuable employees to join the new century -by getting off of the telephone.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                   <strong>When you have faster, cheaper deliveries from a fair and open bidding process, everyone wins.</strong> And that's exactly
                    why we built it. Well, actually we build it because we lost millions of dollars by not having a tool like this and learning
                    the hard way, before BuidGrid.
